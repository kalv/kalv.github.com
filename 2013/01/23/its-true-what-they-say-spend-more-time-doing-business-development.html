    <p>When working on a new startup idea, it's easy as a developer to get
comfy working through the backlog and getting on with product delivery.</p>

<p>Someone in the team says or even in your own brain your hear:</p>

<blockquote><p>Oh man this talking to customers/investors all day feels like
we're not getting anywhere, screw this let's take 3 weeks out and get on
with <em>really</em> delivering our product by coding</p></blockquote>

<p>I've said it myself in the past. But I've been learning recently that in
early stages of product market fit that I should resist this urge.</p>

<p>Why? Because most of that development time you end up building features
that you actually didn't need or even worse realize too late that
customers don't want what you're building.</p>

<p>What do I do now? I take an idea in it's most basic form, enough to sell
it to a real customer. The most minimum I need to sell
it, even if it's just a verbal spiel then that's enough.</p>

<p>Take that bare minimum and speak to as many customers as I can find. If
the verbal presentation is not enough then knock up some quick
wireframes (don't code!) and walk through that with them.</p>

<p>I always remind myself to not speak with my peers or friends, trying hard to find <em>real</em>
customers. Friends will always be nice and say "hmm yeah I'd like that,
use it".</p>

<p>This thinking has been great at stopping a direction quickly before
wasting a couple of weeks/months developing out an idea or feature.</p>

<p>Taking this iterative approach makes sure we're only
delivering the bare minimum until we get to taking a payment and not
spending too much time deliberating on internal opinions on what's right or not.</p>

<p>The project then gets into an early strategy to talk early and to
continue talking to the customers keeping us on track.</p>
