  <div id="content">
    <p>I've been a Ruby guy for over 4 years now and have always found the language fun and the frameworks suitable for building web based applications, I love it.</p>

<p>Since the release of <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> in 2009, I and my colleagues at
<a href="http://www.gofreerange.com">GoFreeRange</a> were very excited about the
event loop, non-blocking IO goodness for scalability and speed on the
web. We had even played on something to help
<a href="https://github.com/freerange/nodetest">testing</a> (was only for a day, just to learn more about the tech).</p>

<p>So I've been looking for the right time to start developing a real
application that benefits from what Node.js has to offer over what I can
do quickly and efficiently in Ruby.</p>

<p>I have yet to see an API or website
really need the scalability or speed offered by node.js over what I know
with ruby, so I've always chosen to use what I know, has good
conventions and good maintainability.</p>

<p>But last week the time finally arrived where Node.js might be a better
fit.</p>

<p>This won't be a post outlining benchmark metrics but just an overview of
my findings and how I settled on Node.js for this specific need.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Our feed checking mechanism at <a href="http://rsshero.com">RSS Hero</a> was built
using <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a> so that we could fetch
multiple feeds and check them (making sure they are a feed). Then to
subscribe with <a href="http://superfeedr.com">Superfeedr</a> if successful.</p>

<p>This process was not fast enough for fetching lots of feeds, I found
that activating a couple of users that each had 1000 subscriptions or so,
it would stack up and take quite a while to churn through.</p>

<p>Even though I could increase the number of resque workers running in parallel I would end up using more memory on our limited production servers.</p>

<p>HTTP feed fetching is going to increase, one of our upcoming milestones
is to take load away from superfeedr and fetch some feeds ourselves.</p>

<h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>

<p>To make this faster I needed to use less memory and be able to fetch
multiple HTTP requests in parallel.  The shortlist that I came up with was:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">Eventmachine</a> &amp;
<a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-http-request">em-http-request</a> - A ruby event loop allowing async processing</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dbalatero/typhoeus">Typhoeus</a> - Http fetching using curb (curl)</li>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> - event driven, non-blocking IO</li>
</ul>


<p>So to figure out which was best I set a time box of 1/2 day to spike on each method and learn about them.</p>

<p>With each test setup I used <a href="http://redis.io/topics/pubsub">Redis
pubsub</a> to push urls to be fetched onto a channel and have the fetching code consume that channel.  This would allow easy integration from the existing rails app.</p>

<p>Also to remove bandwidth fluctuations from my ISP I ran the tests on a
<a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> server.</p>

<h2>Eventmachine</h2>

<p>This was my first choice and I believed it would be good enough for our
needs.  I would be able to use my existing tested ruby code for the feed
checking and connect it to redis.</p>

<p>The first issue and main one was eventmachine kept on stalling.  When
the sample data was loaded, the compatible redis library
(<a href="https://github.com/mloughran/em-hiredis">em-hiredis</a>) would read off
all the messages off the pubsub channel and kick off http requests,
responses then stopped after the first 100 requests.</p>

<p>I thought it might be an issue with trying to send too many requests at
one time. So I tried using <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-synchrony">em-synchrony</a> which is a lovely library to allow synchronous control in the event loop, but it stopped the async nature of the http requesting so slowed it back down.</p>

<p>To better manage the concurrency I then tried to store the received urls from redis into a shared
variable and then poll that collection (EM::PeriodicTimer) and only fire
off a limited amount of http requests. This worked well until 300-400
requests were sent, again eventmachine stalled for a 1-5 secs and then
came back again.</p>

<p>After spending a bit of time debugging and digging into my limited
knowledge of Eventmachine and em-http I couldn't see what was happening. All I could
see was that the event loop was not 'ticking', the timer was not firing
so maybe something had blocked the IO loop. Using 1000 requests to a
localhost web address worked fine, so maybe it was something in the
network layer, maybe an address not returning, DNS hanging. I did find
evidence to show that the HTTP Connection was <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-http-request/blob/master/lib/em-http/http_connection.rb#L75">not fully
asynchronous</a> so
perhaps one or a couple of network connections were blocking.</p>

<p>I fiddled with adding timeout settings to the http request but nothing
stopped hitting this stall.</p>

<p>With my limited time for this spike and this stability issue I moved on.</p>

<h2>Typhoeus</h2>

<p>I have used curb before for fast feed fetching at
<a href="http://twitterfeed.com">Twitterfeed</a>, where I used a modified
<a href="https://github.com/kalv/feedzirra">feedzirra</a> that allowed multiple http feed fetching, this worked very well at the time.</p>

<p>Comparing this though to the speed I was getting with Eventmachine it
was slow, a fire off of 10 http requests would still wait for them all
to return, which was too slow.</p>

<p>Again I had to manage my own concurrency when reading urls to be fetched
from redis.</p>

<p>This being too slow, I moved on to node.js.</p>

<h2>Node.js</h2>

<p>Already knowing javascript, I got it running pretty quickly and the
responses came through fast. I can't say exactly but it responses for
for the first hundre came through a lot quicker and it stayed
consistently fast.</p>

<p>I didn't have to worry about concurrency control, internally node.js
seemed to manage and handle the requests fine.</p>

<p>I had to write my own code to handle redirects and to put a cap on how
many to follow before throwing an exception as I was using the http
request library included in Node.js.</p>

<p>The results from the little testing on Node.js was amazing. It felt
solid and fast. This was enough for me to take the plunge and deploy
some node.js.</p>

<h2>To Summarize</h2>

<p>I chose to use node.js because it was faster, stable and used a lower
memory footprint on my server.</p>

<p><a href="http://rsshero.com">RSS Hero</a> is now using node.js for it's http
fetching and memory usage has reduced from 400mb of RAM to 20mb and it's a lot faster.</p>
